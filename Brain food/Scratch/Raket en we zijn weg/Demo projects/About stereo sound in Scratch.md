Scratch by default does not support stereo sounds. The stereo sound for the rocket and astronaut is added by:

- Renaming the Scratch .sb3-file to .zip
- Replacing the .mp3's in the zip with stereo mp3's
- Renaming the .zip back to .sb3

Beware: as soon as you open the sounds in Scratch they will be converted to mono...
Also: Scratch projects with stereo mp3's cannot be uploaded to the Scratch website...
